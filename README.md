# Visio Converter

Simple WPF application used to "silently" convert `.vsd` multiple files to `.vsdx` files

**Note that this app requires Microsoft Visio to make the conversion**\
Executes a Visio instance in the background, opens a file and saves it with the output extension

Based in the [vsd converter server](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/tree/ae98ad585641179f4d819154c2979614c9e609c6/etc/vsd) published by drawio in previous versions
